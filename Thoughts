User wants a Rubik's Cube Solver with: 1. FastAPI + React + MongoDB (perfect for our environment) 2. 2D unfolded cube grid for input (6 faces laid out flat) 3. Beginner's layer-by-layer method (white cross, white corners, middle layer, yellow cross, yellow edges, yellow corners) 4. Step-by-step visual animations showing moves This is a complex project involving: - 2D cube interface with clickable squares for inputting current state - Cube state representation and validation - Layer-by-layer solving algorithm implementation - Move notation system (R, U, L, D, F, B, etc.) - Visual animations for each move - Backend API to process cube states and generate solutions The hardest parts will be: 1. Implementing the layer-by-layer solving algorithm correctly 2. Creating smooth visual animations for cube moves 3. Mapping between 2D input interface and internal 3D cube representation 4. Validating cube states (ensuring they're solvable) I should start by exploring the current setup, then tackle the hardest part first - the solving algorithm - and build the interface around it.
