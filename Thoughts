User wants a Rubik's Cube Solver with: 1. FastAPI + React + MongoDB (perfect for our environment) 2. 2D unfolded cube grid for input (6 faces laid out flat) 3. Beginner's layer-by-layer method (white cross, white corners, middle layer, yellow cross, yellow edges, yellow corners) 4. Step-by-step visual animations showing moves This is a complex project involving: - 2D cube interface with clickable squares for inputting current state - Cube state representation and validation - Layer-by-layer solving algorithm implementation - Move notation system (R, U, L, D, F, B, etc.) - Visual animations for each move - Backend API to process cube states and generate solutions The hardest parts will be: 1. Implementing the layer-by-layer solving algorithm correctly 2. Creating smooth visual animations for cube moves 3. Mapping between 2D input interface and internal 3D cube representation 4. Validating cube states (ensuring they're solvable) I should start by exploring the current setup, then tackle the hardest part first - the solving algorithm - and build the interface around it.


Perfect! Now I understand the current setup. Let me create a comprehensive plan for building the Rubik's Cube Solver:
Action: Now I understand the current setup:

BACKEND:
- FastAPI with /api prefix routing
- MongoDB connection configured
- Basic CORS setup
- Environment variables properly configured

FRONTEND:
- React with React Router
- Axios for API calls
- Backend URL properly configured via environment variables
- Basic template with routing

PLAN FOR RUBIK'S CUBE SOLVER:

PHASE 1: Core Algorithm Implementation (Backend)
1. Research and implement the layer-by-layer solving algorithm
2. Create cube state representation (6 faces, 9 squares each)
3. Implement move notation system (R, U, L, D, F, B, R', U', etc.)
4. Create validation logic for cube states
5. Implement step-by-step solving logic

PHASE 2: API Endpoints (Backend)
1. POST /api/cube/solve - accept cube state, return step-by-step solution
2. POST /api/cube/validate - validate if cube state is solvable
3. GET /api/cube/scramble - generate random scrambled cube

PHASE 3: 2D Cube Interface (Frontend)
1. Create 2D unfolded cube grid component (6 faces)
2. Color picker for each square
3. Cube state management
4. Visual representation of current cube state

PHASE 4: Visual Animations (Frontend)
1. Move animation system
2. Step-by-step solution display
3. Play/pause/step controls
4. Animation speed controls

PHASE 5: Integration & Testing
1. Connect frontend to backend
2. Test solving algorithm with various cube states
3. Test animations and user experience

The HARDEST part is implementing the layer-by-layer algorithm correctly. I should tackle this first, then build the interface around it.

Let me start with Phase 1 - implementing the core solving algorithm.
Observation: Your thought has been logged.
